					<h2>The First GNU</h2>
					<h5 style = "color: gray; padding = 0px;">Poem by unknown</h5>
					<p>The first GNU that Stallman did give
Was to certain poor users at screens where they lived
At screen where they lived, wrecking code and text
For the syntax of TECO did leave them perplexed
GNU, GNU, GNU, GNU
Emacs is RMS through and through
<br>
<br>
He hack\'{e}d on and worked in C
To improve its response and efficiency
Efficiency was his intent
So it wolfs resources where'er it's sent
<br>
<br>
GNU, GNU, GNU, GNU
Emacs is RMS through and through
<br>
<br>
And by the light of that same core
Built the biggest library ye ever saw
Which hath more hooks than a fly-fisher's hat
And a Tech Reference writ by a true Lispocrat
<br>
<br>
GNU, GNU, GNU, GNU
Emacs is RMS through and through
<br>
<br>
When thou hast writ thy visited file
If it be e-lisp, thou canst it compile
And hooks employ, and a key-sequence set
And thou makest its gloriousness greater yet
<br>
<br>
GNU, GNU, GNU, GNU
Emacs is RMS through and through
<br>
<br>
So how to quit once thou art through?
Clearly Esc-Meta-Altmode-Cokebottle-Shift-Q
But with Zippy and GNews and Eliza as well
Ye need never again seek the prompt of a shell
<br>
<br>
GNU, GNU, GNU, GNU
Emacs is RMS through and through
<br>
<br>
So let us all our voices swell
Praise Stallman for his GPL
Which giveth wond'rous things for naught
And his creed of software freedom hath taught
<br>
<br>
GNU, GNU, GNU, GNU
Emacs is RMS through and through</p>
